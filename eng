Hi I am pandean. Thank you for your time to let me introdence myself. I graduated in 2012 then I have six years experience about java and web. After graduated I joined huaxin technology company which start my career. During this time I participated in many projects. Although I am a junior developer, I archived a lot of technolog knowledge with hard working. 
I joined in YuTong company created by my colleagues in 2015.  I become a senior developer about java web front end. Because the less people then eveyone has more work but I can complete those. I took part in a lot of project such as qianye online shop, gome fitment. I realized I had a lot of to learn.
